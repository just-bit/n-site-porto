Yes. You can try to use OpenAI model 4o Mini and try with this prompt: 

"Develop a WordPress plugin that prompts visitors to verify their age before accessing the site. The age verification pop-up must be displayed in fullscreen mode. It should include a title, a subtitle, descriptive text, and a button for user interaction. Users must be able to close the pop-up by clicking the button. Once closed, the pop-up should not reappear for the same user for a duration of 5 days. Implement customizer option to enable or disable the pop-up. Also, provide options to customize the title, subtitle, descriptive text, and button text displayed in the pop-up"

= One more? =
 
Of course: 

"Develop a WordPress plugin that enables administrators to clone posts with a single click. Implement a button on the single post editing screen and another button on the post list in the admin area. Ensure that when a post is cloned, all associated categories, media attachments, tags, meta data, and other taxonomies are duplicated.
